# Bank Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Assignment

## Problem Statement

Customer churn prediction is an important business problem where organizations aim to identify customers likely to leave their services. This project focuses on predicting bank customer churn using multiple machine learning classification models and deploying the solution through an interactive Streamlit web application.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset used is the **Bank Customer Churn Prediction Dataset** obtained from Kaggle.
It contains approximately 10,000 customer records with multiple demographic and financial features.

**Target Variable:**

* `Exited` → Indicates whether the customer left the bank (1) or stayed (0).

**Key Features Include:**

* Credit score, age, balance, tenure, salary
* Geography and gender information
* Account activity indicators

The dataset satisfies assignment requirements with more than 500 instances and over 12 features.

---

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent preprocessing including:
- Removal of irrelevant identifier columns
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-test split for unbiased evaluation

---

## Machine Learning Models Implemented

The following classification models were trained and evaluated on the same dataset:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
* Random Forest (Ensemble)
* XGBoost (Ensemble)

## Observations on Model Performance

* **Random Forest** achieved the best overall performance with highest accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and MCC, indicating strong generalization capability.
* **XGBoost** also performed well and showed balanced predictive performance.
* **Logistic Regression** provided decent accuracy but very low recall, suggesting difficulty in identifying churn customers.
* **Decision Tree** showed moderate performance but likely overfitting compared to ensemble models.
* **KNN and Naive Bayes** offered stable baseline performance but were less effective than ensemble approaches.
* Dataset class imbalance impacts recall, making ensemble models more suitable for this task.

## Streamlit Web Application

An interactive Streamlit application was developed to demonstrate model predictions.
Key features include:

* CSV dataset upload option
* Model selection dropdown
* Display of evaluation metrics
* Confusion matrix / classification report
